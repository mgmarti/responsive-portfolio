               <h3>Hi there!</h3>
                <p>
                    Welcome to my portfolio. My name is Monica.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have an educational background in digital media&#58; print and packaging design and in integrated communications, but my professional background is secondary education.
                    I worked with PreK for four years before moving up to teach sixth grade. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I was introduced to web development during the early years of my college career, but ended up pursuing print and packaging design.
                    I&#39;ve recently decided to further explore the fascinating world of web development and I&#39;m hooked.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Besides spending my time in front of a computer screen lesson planning or learning to write code&#44; I enjoy spending time outdoors.
                    I currently enjoy visiting national parks when I have the time. One of my favorites is Zion National Park in Utah. I also consider watching movies one of my hobbies.
